# 🧪 Pandas Program: Join Two DataFrames Along Rows

## 🎯 AIM

To write a Python program using Pandas to **join two DataFrames along rows** (row-wise concatenation) and assign all data to a new DataFrame.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the `pandas` library.
2. **Create First DataFrame**: Use a dictionary to create `student_data1`.
3. **Create Second DataFrame**: Use another dictionary to create `student_data2`.
4. **Concatenate DataFrames**: Use `pd.concat()` with `axis=0` to concatenate both DataFrames row-wise.
5. **Display Result**: Print the new combined DataFrame.

## Result
Thus, the Python program has been successfully created and executed successfully to join the 
two DataFrames row-wise using pd.concat() and all records from both DataFrames were 
included in the final output .
